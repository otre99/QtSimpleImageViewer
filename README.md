# QtSimpleImageViewer
This is a very simple but fast image viewer. You can associate the program with image files in order to open images with double-click.

## How to create the app?

Use QtCreator to open ```src/ImageViewer.pro``` file and them build the program. Tested in Kubuntu 18.04 with QtSDK 5.12.
