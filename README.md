# QtSimpleImageViewer
This is a very simple but fast image viewer. You can associate the program with image files in order to open images with double-click.

## How to create the app?

Use QtCreator to open ```src/CMakeLists.txt``` file and them build the program, or you can directly use ```SimpleQtImageViewer-x86_64.AppImage```. Tested in Ubuntu 20.04 with QtSDK 5.12.
